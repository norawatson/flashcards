# Flashcards

This is an app for students to practice with flash cards in my math classes. It is built with SvelteKit and Firebase.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## To do

- [ ] Add a way to create new cards (set up Firebase)
- [ ] Add a way to create new decks
- [ ] Image uploading
- [ ] Progress tracking
